### Problem of buying stocks on margin:
You lost more than you invested when buying stock margins. You need to make sure your money didn’t go down or you’ll ask for loan after loan. Mainly the way the money went down is because many of the stocks wouldn’t go up. This caused a lot of business to go bankrupt.
